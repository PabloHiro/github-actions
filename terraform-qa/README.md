# terraform-qa

This action will apply [pre-commit-terraform](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform) and [pre-commit-hooks](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks).

It will also apply the linting rules and commit them in the same branch where the action is executed. Action will appear in green if all linting issues could be fixed automatically.
